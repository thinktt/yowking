RabbitMQ: RabbitMQ is one of the most widely deployed open source message brokers. It supports multiple messaging protocols, message queuing, delivery acknowledgement, flexible routing to queues, and multiple exchange type.

Apache Kafka: Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed to handle real-time data feeds with high throughput and low latency. It can publish, subscribe, store, and process streams of records in real time.

Redis Pub/Sub: Redis, primarily known as a data structure store, also provides a pub/sub system. It's simple to use but it does not provide a lot of the advanced features that other messaging systems do, such as persistent storage or message acknowledgment.

NATS: NATS is a simple, high performance open source messaging system for cloud native applications, IoT messaging, and microservices architectures.

Mosquitto (MQTT): Mosquitto is an open source message broker that implements MQTT protocol versions 5.0, 3.1.1 and 3.1. MQTT is a lightweight pub/sub messaging protocol designed for M2M (Machine to Machine) telemetry in low bandwidth environments.

Apache Pulsar: Apache Pulsar is a cloud-native, distributed messaging and streaming platform that manages hundreds of billions of events per day. It was originally developed by Yahoo.
