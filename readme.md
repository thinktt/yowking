# The King Chess Service
The King service turns Johan de Koning's chess engine [The King](https://www.chessprogramming.org/The_King), used by the the [Chessmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chessmaster) game series, into a web service and command line tool. 

This service also uses the CM personality files to make the original 180 chess personalitities from Chessmaster available directly via the API.

Now you can play Fischer against Karpov from a linux termial or a using the King service web API, and Fischer will have to show up this time!

## What you'll need
1. A Copy of Chessmaster 11
2. Docker
3. Kubernetes (if you want to scale the service)
